### What is Node.js?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. It enables developers to use JavaScript to write command-line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a 'JavaScript everywhere' paradigm, unifying web application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server-side and client-side scripts.
Built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices. Node.js also comes with a vast ecosystem of open-source libraries available through the npm package manager.
