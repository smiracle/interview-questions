### What is REST?

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It relies on a stateless, client-server, cacheable communications protocol -- typically HTTP. In REST, resources are manipulated using a fixed set of operations. REST is designed to use a stateless communication protocol, often HTTP, making it an ideal choice for web services and APIs.
A RESTful web service exposes a set of resources that identify the targets of the interaction with its clients. Resources are defined in URLs, providing a global addressing space for resource and service discovery. RESTful services use HTTP methods explicitly, making it a powerful, performant, and scalable approach to building web services.
