### What is CSS?

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS defines how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media. It is one of the cornerstone technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. CSS enables web designers and developers to separate the content of a website from its design and layout, allowing for more flexibility, accessibility, and control in the specification of presentation characteristics.
