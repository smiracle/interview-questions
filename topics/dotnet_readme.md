### What is .Net?

.NET is a free, cross-platform, open-source developer platform for building many different types of applications. With .NET, you can use multiple languages, editors, and libraries to build for web, mobile, desktop, games, and IoT. Depending on the type of application you want to build, you can choose .NET Core for cross-platform development, .NET Framework for Windows apps and services, and Xamarin/Mono for mobile apps. .NET provides a unified set of APIs across all .NET platforms, with additional APIs for specific operating systems. It also supports cloud, IoT, machine learning, microservices, and more with an extensive class library and runtime.
