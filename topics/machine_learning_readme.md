### What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves. The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples we provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.
Machine learning involves algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. It's used in a wide range of applications, such as in email filtering, detection of network intruders, and computer vision, where it's difficult or infeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.
