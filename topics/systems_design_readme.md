### What is DNS?

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system used for computers, services, or any resource connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Most prominently, it translates more readily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for locating and identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols.

DNS is fundamental to the functionality of the internet, providing a quick and user-friendly way of accessing websites without needing to remember the numerical IP addresses of web servers. It's often described as the "phonebook of the internet" because it converts human-readable domain names into machine-readable IP addresses, allowing browsers to load Internet resources.


How DNS Works:
- 1. DNS Query: When you type a web address (e.g., www.example.com) into your browser, your computer sends a DNS query to find the corresponding IP address for that website.
- 2. Recursive Resolver: The query first goes to a DNS recursive resolver, typically operated by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). If the resolver has the IP address in its cache from a previous lookup, it returns the address to your computer. If not, it queries further.
- 3. Root Name Servers: The resolver then queries one of the root name servers. The root server responds with the address of a Top-Level Domain (TLD) name server (e.g., .com, .net, .org) that stores information for its domains.
- 4. TLD (Top Level Domain) Name Servers: The resolver next queries the TLD name server, which responds with the IP address of the domain's authoritative name server.
- 5. Authoritative Name Servers: Finally, the resolver queries the authoritative name server for the web address. This server has access to the domain's records and responds with the IP address of the server where the website is hosted.
- 6. Resolution: The DNS resolver sends the IP address back to your computer. Your computer can then make a direct request to the web server at that IP address to access the website.
- Domain: A human-friendly address of a website (e.g., www.example.com).
- IP Address: A unique numeric identifier for each device on a network.
- DNS Resolver: Acts as a mediator between the user and DNS servers to find the correct IP address.
- Root Name Servers: The top of the DNS hierarchy that directs queries to TLD name servers based on the extension (.com, .net, etc.).
- TLD Name Servers: Manage the second-level domain names such as .com, .net, etc. Authoritative Name Servers: Hold the DNS records for individual domains, providing the exact 6.

### What is lower latency interaction?

Low latency means that there is very little delay between the time you request something and the time you get a response. As it applies to webSockets, it just means that data can be sent quicker (particularly over slow links) because the connection has already been established so no extra packet roundtrips are required to establish the TCP connection.
