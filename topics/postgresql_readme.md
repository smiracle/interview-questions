### What is PostgreSQL?

PostgreSQL is an open-source, object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) with an emphasis on extensibility and standards compliance. Developed by the PostgreSQL Global Development Group, it is one of the most advanced and widely used database systems. PostgreSQL supports a wide range of data types, including primitive types, structured types, and custom types, making it highly flexible for different data storage needs.
It offers robust features to ensure data integrity, including complex SQL queries, foreign keys, triggers, updatable views, and transactional integrity. It is designed for scalability, high availability, and compatibility with various programming languages and environments. PostgreSQL's advanced features, such as Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC), point-in-time recovery, and asynchronous replication, make it suitable for high-volume environments and complex applications.
