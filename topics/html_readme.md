### What is HTML?

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages, and are represented by tags written using angle brackets. HTML tags label pieces of content such as 'heading', 'paragraph', 'table', and so on. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page. HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Layout and appearance of the elements within a webpage are typically controlled by CSS.
