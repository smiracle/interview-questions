### What is SOAP?

SOAP, which stands for Simple Object Access Protocol, is a messaging protocol specification for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services in computer networks. Its purpose is to induce extensibility, neutrality, and independence. It uses XML Information Set for its message format, and relies on application layer protocols, most notably Remote Procedure Call (RPC) and HTTP, for message negotiation and transmission.
SOAP allows developers to create powerfully integrated web applications over the network. With SOAP, it's possible to invoke methods on servers, services, components, and objects, given that those entities are exposed to the network. This makes SOAP a cornerstone in the realm of distributed computing and web services, facilitating actions such as querying databases or calling functions from different machines and networks.
