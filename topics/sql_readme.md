### What is SQL?

SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing and manipulating relational database management systems. It is particularly useful for handling structured data, where there are relationships between different entities/variables of the data. SQL offers a way to insert, query, update, and modify data within databases. Developed in the 1970s, SQL has been standardized by both ANSI and ISO, with multiple versions over the years.
SQL commands can be used to interact with a database, such as to retrieve data from a database (SELECT), insert records in a database (INSERT), update records in a database (UPDATE), delete records from a database (DELETE), create new databases (CREATE DATABASE), create new tables in a database (CREATE TABLE), create stored procedures in a database (CREATE PROCEDURE), set permissions on tables, procedures, and views (GRANT/REVOKE), and much more.
