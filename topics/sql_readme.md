### What is SQL?

SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing and manipulating relational database management systems. It is particularly useful for handling structured data, where there are relationships between different entities/variables of the data. SQL offers a way to insert, query, update, and modify data within databases. Developed in the 1970s, SQL has been standardized by both ANSI and ISO, with multiple versions over the years.
SQL commands can be used to interact with a database, such as to retrieve data from a database (SELECT), insert records in a database (INSERT), update records in a database (UPDATE), delete records from a database (DELETE), create new databases (CREATE DATABASE), create new tables in a database (CREATE TABLE), create stored procedures in a database (CREATE PROCEDURE), set permissions on tables, procedures, and views (GRANT/REVOKE), and much more.

### What is PostgreSQL?

PostgreSQL is an open-source, object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) with an emphasis on extensibility and standards compliance. Developed by the PostgreSQL Global Development Group, it is one of the most advanced and widely used database systems. PostgreSQL supports a wide range of data types, including primitive types, structured types, and custom types, making it highly flexible for different data storage needs.
It offers robust features to ensure data integrity, including complex SQL queries, foreign keys, triggers, updatable views, and transactional integrity. It is designed for scalability, high availability, and compatibility with various programming languages and environments. PostgreSQL's advanced features, such as Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC), point-in-time recovery, and asynchronous replication, make it suitable for high-volume environments and complex applications.
