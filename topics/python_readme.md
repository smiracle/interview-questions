### What is Python?

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from web development to scientific computing.
Python's comprehensive standard library, open-source development model, and support for modules and packages enhance its modularity and reusability. It's one of the most popular programming languages in the world, used by beginners and professionals alike. Python's syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than might be used in languages such as C++ or Java.
