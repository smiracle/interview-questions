### What is Rust?

Rust is a systems programming language focused on speed, memory safety, and parallelism. It is designed to be a safe, concurrent, practical language, supporting functional and imperative-procedural paradigms. Rust prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety, enabling developers to build fast, efficient software without worrying about the common pitfalls of memory management.
Rust's powerful type system and ownership model guarantee memory-safety and thread-safety features at compile time. The Rust compiler's checks ensure that code adheres to these rules, making it difficult to introduce bugs related to memory management. Rust also offers zero-cost abstractions, iterators, and closures, making it both efficient and expressive.
