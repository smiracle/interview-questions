### What is NoSQL?

NoSQL databases are designed to store, distribute, and access data using methods that differ from relational databases. These databases are known for their ability to handle large volumes of unstructured, semi-structured, or structured data. They provide flexible schemas and scale easily with large amounts of data and high user loads. NoSQL databases are categorized into four main types: document, key-value, wide-column, and graph databases, each serving different data storage requirements.
NoSQL databases excel in applications that require rapid development, horizontal scalability, and the ability to handle a wide variety of data types. They are commonly used in big data analytics, real-time web applications, and IoT (Internet of Things) applications. The flexibility of NoSQL databases allows developers to make changes to the database schema without impacting existing data, enabling faster iteration and development cycles.
