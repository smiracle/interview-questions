Users can type commands at the shell prompt, and the shell executes them and displays the results. The shell also provides programming features to help automate repetitive tasks, manage files, and execute software."

The most commonly used shells include the Bourne shell (sh), C shell (csh), Korn shell (ksh), Bourne Again shell (bash), and Z shell (zsh). Each shell has its own syntax for scripting but provides similar functionality."
