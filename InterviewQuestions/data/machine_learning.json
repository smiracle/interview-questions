          "value": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves. The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples we provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly."

          "value": "Machine learning involves algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. It's used in a wide range of applications, such as in email filtering, detection of network intruders, and computer vision, where it's difficult or infeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks."

      "answers": [
        "Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building.",
        "It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.",
        "Machine learning algorithms are used primarily for dynamic decision making and predictive analysis.",
        "It involves the memorization of specific data sets to produce an accurate result based on examples.",
        "Machine learning is strictly limited to performing tasks that are explicitly programmed by developers.",
        "It relies on structured, predefined algorithms for all operations, without the capability for improvisation or learning.",
        "Machine learning applications are confined to laboratory research, with few practical applications in real-world scenarios.",
        "The technology cannot process large amounts of data or improve from experience, making it unsuitable for data-intensive applications.",
        "Machine learning algorithms cannot make predictions or decisions based on new, unseen data.",
        "The field of machine learning does not intersect with artificial intelligence, operating as a completely separate area of study."
