This allows instances in both VPCs to communicate securely as if they are on the same network.\n\nVPN Connection: Establish a VPN connection between the VPCs or on-premises networks associated with each AWS account. This ensures secure communication over the internet.\n\nAWS Direct Connect: Create a dedicated network connection using AWS Direct Connect between the on-premises network and the VPCs. This provides a reliable and consistent network experience.\n\nTransit Gateway: Deploy a Transit Gateway in one AWS account and attach VPCs from both accounts. It acts as a central hub for routing traffic between VPCs, simplifying connectivity management.\n\nAWS PrivateLink: Utilize AWS PrivateLink to securely access services across VPCs without exposing traffic to the public internet. PrivateLink establishes private connectivity using Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs).\n\nCross-Account IAM Roles: Set up IAM roles to allow secure access between applications in different AWS accounts without sharing credentials. This ensures controlled access to resources."
