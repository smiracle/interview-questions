                    "value": "Docker is an open-source platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. It enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container. Containers are lightweight, portable, and provide a consistent runtime environment for applications, ensuring that they run the same, regardless of where they are deployed. Docker automates the repetitive tasks of setting up and configuring development environments, making it easier to build, test, and deploy applications swiftly and securely."
