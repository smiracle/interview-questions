          "value": "REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It relies on a stateless, client-server, cacheable communications protocol -- typically HTTP. In REST, resources are manipulated using a fixed set of operations. REST is designed to use a stateless communication protocol, often HTTP, making it an ideal choice for web services and APIs."

          "value": "A RESTful web service exposes a set of resources that identify the targets of the interaction with its clients. Resources are defined in URLs, providing a global addressing space for resource and service discovery. RESTful services use HTTP methods explicitly, making it a powerful, performant, and scalable approach to building web services."

        "REST is an architectural style for developing web services that emphasize communication via representational state transfers.",
        "RESTful services primarily communicate using XML for data interchange between client and server.",
        "REST requires maintaining a client-side session to keep track of user state.",
        "A key principle of REST is its reliance on a stateful communication protocol for client-server interactions.",
        "In REST architecture, operations on resources are not explicitly defined, allowing any method to be applied to any resource.",
        "RESTful APIs are limited to a single communication protocol, HTTPS, for security reasons.",
        "One of the constraints of REST is that it does not support asynchronous operations and real-time communication.",
        "RESTful services cannot be cached, making them less efficient for frequent data retrieval operations.",
        "The use of URLs in REST is restricted to static paths, not allowing parameters or query string inputs for dynamic resource access.",
        "REST is specifically designed for use in distributed systems, requiring complex coordination and configuration between servers."
