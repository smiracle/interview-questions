                    "value": "Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language that is intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. Java is used to develop mobile apps, web apps, desktop apps, games, and much more. It is known for its simplicity, portability, and robust features that make it suitable for networked and distributed environments."
