          "value": "Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. It enables developers to use JavaScript to write command-line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a 'JavaScript everywhere' paradigm, unifying web application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server-side and client-side scripts."

          "value": "Built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices. Node.js also comes with a vast ecosystem of open-source libraries available through the npm package manager."

        "Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine that executes JavaScript code server-side.",
        "Node.js is primarily used for front-end development, enabling interactive elements on websites.",
        "It relies on a multi-threaded blocking I/O model to handle multiple connections simultaneously.",
        "Node.js uses the PHP engine for script execution to enhance its compatibility with traditional web technologies.",
        "It is unsuitable for real-time applications due to its high overhead and slow performance in handling concurrent connections.",
        "Node.js does not support the use of npm packages, limiting its utility in modern web development.",
        "It exclusively supports the JavaScript programming language, with no ability to execute code written in other languages.",
        "Node.js applications are less scalable due to their reliance on synchronous execution for I/O operations.",
        "The runtime environment does not allow for event-driven programming, making it less efficient for web servers.",
        "Node.js's architecture leads to increased memory consumption for high-load applications, making it less efficient than other server-side technologies."
