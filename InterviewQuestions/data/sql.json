          "value": "SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing and manipulating relational database management systems. It is particularly useful for handling structured data, where there are relationships between different entities/variables of the data. SQL offers a way to insert, query, update, and modify data within databases. Developed in the 1970s, SQL has been standardized by both ANSI and ISO, with multiple versions over the years."
