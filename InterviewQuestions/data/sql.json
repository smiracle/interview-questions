          "value": "SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing and manipulating relational database management systems. It is particularly useful for handling structured data, where there are relationships between different entities/variables of the data. SQL offers a way to insert, query, update, and modify data within databases. Developed in the 1970s, SQL has been standardized by both ANSI and ISO, with multiple versions over the years."

Developed by the PostgreSQL Global Development Group, it is one of the most advanced and widely used database systems. PostgreSQL supports a wide range of data types, including primitive types, structured types, and custom types, making it highly flexible for different data storage needs."
