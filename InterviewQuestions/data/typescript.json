It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript, adding optional static typing to the language. TypeScript is designed for development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript. As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs."

It includes features from ES6 and beyond, plus a way to add static type-checking to your code, or to use TypeScriptâ€™s own type system, which includes even more capabilities, such as interfaces and enums."
