          "value": "Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving a particular problem. Together, data structures and algorithms provide a foundation for efficient problem-solving with computers. They enable developers to handle large amounts of data effectively, perform operations on data quickly, and solve complex computational problems. By choosing the appropriate data structure and algorithm, programmers can optimize the performance and resource usage of their applications."
