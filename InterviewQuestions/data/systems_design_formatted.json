It is the process of identifying, creating, and designing systems that meet a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s or organization\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s specific objectives and expectations. Systems design is more about system analysis, architectural patterns, APIs, design patterns, and glueing it all together than it is about coding. Because your application will be able to handle the architectural load, designing your system adequately for the requirements of your application will eliminate unnecessary costs and maintenance efforts, as well as provide a better experience for your end-users."
