It addresses several challenges in distributed systems, including scalability, high availability, load distribution, data locality, fault tolerance, simplifying data management, and decentralization. By ensuring keys are evenly spread across nodes, consistent hashing improves load distribution and reduces hot spots. It facilitates easy scaling and data replication, enhancing system availability and fault tolerance. The use of virtual nodes and hashing functions optimizes key distribution and minimizes management overhead, while integration with system components ensures seamless operation. Consistent hashing's adaptability to workload and data distribution variations, along with minimal overhead for operations, makes it a cornerstone technique for designing robust, efficient distributed systems."

It is usually implemented with a first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue. When a request arrives, the system checks if the queue is full. If it is not full, the request is added to the queue. Otherwise, the request is dropped. Requests are pulled and processed at regular intervals. Memory efficient given the limited queue size. Requests are processed at a fixed rate therefore it is suitable for use cases that a stable outflow rate is needed. A burst of traffic fills up the queue with old requests, and if they are not processed in time, recent requests will be rate limited. There are two parameters in the algorithm. It might not be easy to tune them properly.",

Timestamp data is usually kept in cache, such as sorted sets of Redis. When a new request comes in, remove all the outdated timestamps. Outdated timestamps are defined as those older than the start of the current time window. Add timestamp of the new request to the log. If the log size is the same or lower than the allowed count, a request is accepted. Otherwise, it is rejected. Rate limiting implemented by this algorithm is very accurate. In any rolling window, requests will not exceed the rate limit. The algorithm consumes a lot of memory because even if a request is rejected, its timestamp might still be stored in memory.",

The algorithm can be implemented by two different approaches. It smooths out spikes in traffic because the rate is based on the average rate of the previous window. Memory efficient. It only works for not-so-strict look back window. It is an approximation of the actual rate because it assumes requests in the previous window are evenly distributed. However, this problem may not be as bad as it seems. According to experiments done by Cloudflare, only 0.003% of requests are wrongly allowed or rate limited among 400 million requests."
