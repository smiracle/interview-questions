                "Security practices in software development only need to be considered during the final stages of the project, just before deployment.",
                "Security in software development is a one-time process that, once implemented, guarantees the software is secure forever.",
                "Secure coding practices are optional and can be considered as an enhancement rather than a necessity in software development.",
                "Conducting security assessments is only necessary for software projects dealing with sensitive or financial information.",
                "Adopting security frameworks and standards restricts the creativity and flexibility of developers in the software development process.",
                "Security in software development is focused on creating complex password requirements for end-users.",
                "Regular security assessments and code reviews significantly slow down the software development process and are often skipped to meet deadlines.",
                "Security in software development addresses risks only in the deployment phase, ignoring the planning, design, and maintenance phases."
