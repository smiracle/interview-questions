Class components are ES6 classes that extend from React.Component and can have state and lifecycle methods. Functional components are simpler functions that return JSX and can use hooks for state and side effects. Components can accept and use props to produce different elements based on the input data.

This process is called reconciliation. It ensures that the minimum number of DOM operations are performed, leading to better performance and a smoother user experience. Only the parts of the real DOM that changed are updated. If a component's state or props do not change, React avoids re-rendering that component or manipulating its corresponding DOM nodes. This selective update mechanism further optimizes performance by avoiding unnecessary work."

Components encapsulate their own state and logic, which allows React to track changes at the component level. This granularity helps in optimizing updates and renders. By using the Virtual DOM, frameworks like React can offer a declarative API for defining UI components. Developers describe what the UI should look like for any given state, and the library takes care of efficiently updating the DOM to match that description. This abstraction allows for the creation of dynamic, interactive UIs that are fast and responsive, even with complex applications that have frequent updates."
