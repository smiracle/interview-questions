Also, the whole UI was re-rendered for each incremental change in the application. Later, the initial prototype of React was created with the name FaxJ by Jordan, inspired from XHP. Finally after sometime React was introduced as a new library into JavaScript ecosystem. JSX comes from the idea of XHP."
